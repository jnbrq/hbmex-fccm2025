# SystemC tests

In this directory and its subdirectories, files with `.tb.scala` extension contain objects that derive from `chext.TestBench` class.
These objects generate the SystemVerilog files used in the SystemC testbenches.

All the testbenches can generated by running the `sysc_tb.Emit` object.
