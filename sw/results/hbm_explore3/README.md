In this experiment, we have RAMA IP attached to the output of the ReadEngine.
This experiment attempts to shed light on the internal mechanisms of the RAMA IP.
Somehow, RAMA IP performance does not depend on how ID bits are utilized by the master.
For single-beat workloads, the performance is capped.
